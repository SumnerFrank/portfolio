<!--About Me/Bio Section-->

    <bio>
        <img src="./assets/images/IMG_2378.jpg" alt="photo of Frank Sumner"/>
        <section id="about">I am Frank Sumner. I am a recent UCF graduate as of May 2020. I was born and raised in Florida.
            I finished with a bachelors degree in history which further furnished my ability to think critically, draw conclusions from given information, and how to support those conclusions with evidence.
            While I was in school, I was also working full time at Universal Studios Florida in various roles. I was able to continue to progress my career while continuing my education.
            Time management, project management, and customer support are three of my top skills. 
            I lived in Colorado for around three years where I worked as a project manager and logistics scheduler, all while finishing my last year of college. 
            I decided I wanted to continue reaching further down my career path where I can continue to help people. 
            Whether those people are customers, companies, or co-workers, I've always been in the business of helping.
